Tasks:
- Meghana and Varsha
    - use the same code as in Master.py
    - Split the methods in Master.py into different classes like train.py, test.py, activationFunctions,py, etc..
    - Refactor the code => change variable names, function names, etc...
    - DO NOT write the preprocessing method.... it is different for our data
    - in train.py give a method call to kerasModel.py
    - in test.py call call to kerasModel.py
    - save the npy files with different names

- Rohan:
    - calculating the metrics like accuracy and other model eval params
    - generate plots, graphs for results, etc
    - compare our output with google translate output

- Reetish
    - google translate API implemetation
    - implement the kerasModel.py
    - implement preprocessing.py

MAIN.py
- To be discussed

Documentation
- will start from Nov 23
